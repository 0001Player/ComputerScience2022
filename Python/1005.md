# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, 龍大大"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "Dadalong":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
```
