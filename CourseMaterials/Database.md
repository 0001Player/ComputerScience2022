# relational model
- Edgar F. Codd’s relational model(1970)
  - "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"
- SQL was one of the first commercial languages to use Edgar F. Codd’s relational model. 
- Despite not entirely adhering to the relational model as described by Codd, it became the most widely used database language.
- SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986 and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.
- Since then, the standard has been revised to include a larger set of features. 
- Despite the existence of standards, most SQL code requires at least some changes before being ported to different database systems.
